#define FIXED_POINT can be used for calibration, since the data format
received by the TPM is 16-bit complex

ntimepipe is the number of per-channel time samples per transfer to GPU.
So if number of times per integration is equal to the total number of
time samples in the buffer, then NTIME_PIPE=NTIME. Must be a multiple of 4


Data ordering for input vectors is (running from slowest to fastest)
[time][channel][station][polarization][complexity]

Output matrix has ordering
[channel][station][station][polarization][polarization][complexity]
