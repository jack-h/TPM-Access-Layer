Hi Lin.  A few things to watch for when trying this out:

You have to use jumbo packets to get near to the line rate (~9.6 Gb/sec).

You have to tune the kernel to increase the buffer sizes, and other
parameters.  See below for specifics for our systems and our Mellanox and
solar flare NICs.  Your best results may need different settings.

You also have to set the CPU and IRQ affinities to keep the drivers and
your applications from moving around the CPU.  If you have a dual CPU
machine, you have to make sure to set up the affinities to eliminate any
NUMA problems of applications being in the "wrong" memory banks.
